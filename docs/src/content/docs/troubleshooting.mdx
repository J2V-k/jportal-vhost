# Troubleshooting

No Mess Menu data in dev
- Create `data/mess_menu.json` at the repo root. Restart the dev server if needed.

Offline mode not engaging
- Ensure you’ve loaded data online first so caches exist (attendance/grades/profile). Then toggle offline and reload.

PWA install prompt not showing
- The install prompt appears on Android Chrome and similar. Desktop browsers may not show the same UX. Also ensure you’re not already in standalone mode.

Pyodide assets fail to load offline
- Load the app online at least once to precache CDN assets and local wheel artifacts (`public/artifact`).

Routing breaks on refresh
- The app uses `HashRouter`. Make sure URLs include `#/...` when bookmarking or linking.
