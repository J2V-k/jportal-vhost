You are an expert at extracting structured data from images. I will upload a photo of a weekly mess menu (with days, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). 
Please analyze the image and return the menu in the following JSON format:
{
  "menu": {
    "Monday 19.05.25": {
      "Breakfast": "Aloo Parantha, Dahi, Achar, Bread Jam, Tea, Fruit",
      "Lunch": "Matar Paneer, Mix Dal, Raita, Rice, Roti, Achar, Salad, Boondi",
      "Dinner": "Dum Aloo, Tahri, Raita, Roti, Achar, Salad, Papad, Green Chutney"
    },
    // ...repeat for all days in the image
  }
}
Use the exact date and day format as shown.
List all items for each meal, separated by commas.
Only include the menu, no extra commentary.
